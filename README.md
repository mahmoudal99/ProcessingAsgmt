# How It Works
My program is split into many classes, each class represents a feature in this program.

The main class is called the Galaxy Class, this incorporates setup, settings and draw function. The Galaxy class also controls the mousePressed function which controls what weapon/buttons have been pressed. Finally, the Galaxy class contains the functions which start the animated part of the program, such as the radar and hand scanner. 

Following the Galaxy class i added the Spaceship class, i used this class to build the main parts of the Spaceship such as the windshield, turrets on either side and dashboard, each of these features were created in separate classes too and drawn by created a draw function in each class.
